## 📖 Overview
Spliter is a Solana dApp frontend built with **Next.js**, **create-solana-dapp**, and **Anchor**.  
It connects to the Spliter Anchor program on devnet and allows users to manage group payment splits transparently.

## ✨ Features
- **Create Splits** → as an authority, define contributors, receiver, and target amount.  
- **Contribute to Splits** → pay your share if you’re part of a split.  
- **Release Splits** → authority can release funds to the receiver once all contributions are made.  
- **Browse All Splits** on the homepage, with:  
  - 🔍 **Search** → search splits by `split_name`.  
  - 🎛 **Filters**:  
    - By **payment status**: Paid / Unpaid.  
    - By **release status**: Released / Unreleased.  
    - By **role**: Creator / Contributor / Both.  

This makes it easy for a user to quickly find the exact split they’re involved in.
